<blockquote>
<p>you be goblins.</p>
<p>you are the minions of a dark master, guardians of an evil treasure, protecting it against naughty heroes ; or living in a goblin colony, defending it from orc raids and kidnapping ; or you're simply self-ruling, looting villages in the countryside and terrorizing farmers.</p>
<p>on your own, you're meaningless and weak. but when you mate with your horde, you fear no enemy. unfortunately, fear doesn't prevent you from being hurt.</p>
<p>life is hard when you're generally represented by a stat block.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this game is about playing goblins, loosely based on some rules of <strong>the black hack</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>very important note</strong> this is a pre-beta-version. things can change.</p>
<h2 id="character-generation">character generation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>me be goblin. me name iz sleertz.</p>

<p>pick a name. use a random name generator, or make up your own with as few syllables as you'll like, lots of <em>k's</em> and <em>r's</em> or <em>s's</em> and <em>z's</em>. you may add a nickname.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>examples:</strong> dribs the short, one-eyed zoits, sleertz the quick...</p>

<ul>
<li>d6 initial hit points (<strong>hp</strong>).</li>
<li>dirty, wasted clothes.</li>
<li>fork, spoon, dish (rusty).</li>

<p>your goblin starts at level 0 (<strong>lvl</strong>). optionally, your <strong>gm</strong> may allow to start at <em>lvl</em> 1. see the <em>levelling up</em> section below.</p>

<p>mind you: goblins are small and weak. the <strong>gm</strong> would give you a disadvantage for physical maneuvers when your goblin carries too many or too heavy items.</p>
<p><em>usage die:</em> consumable items have a usage die, representing their quality or quantity. each time this item has been used, the player rolls its usage die. on 1-2, the dice is downgraded by one step. d8 becomes d6, d6 becomes d4, etc.<br />
on a d4, if you roll 1-2, the item is empty, destroyed, etc.</p>
<h3 id="youre-singular">you're singular</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>me speshal. me haz ze mightee shovel o' force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>find your singular trait. it can be as crazy as your <strong>gm</strong> agrees on: a special ability, a legendary artifact, a blessing, scars, a missing limb, an infamous secret...</p>
<p>it may give you and advantage <strong>or a disadvantage</strong> on a given situation. as a guideline, it would be fair to give a &quot;globally useful&quot; singularity for characters with 1-4 <strong>hp</strong>, and a flaw to characters with 5-6 starting <strong>hp</strong>. but this has got to be discussed between the <strong>gm</strong> and the player.</p>
<h2 id="action-rolls">action rolls</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>wadda sink? can jump da kliff?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when it's risky, roll d20 and compare to your <strong>current hp</strong>+7. if it's (strictly) lower, you succeed. otherwise, you fail.</p>
<p>optionally, and depending on the situation, the <strong>gm</strong> may give a partial success if the roll equals the difficulty level.</p>
<p>a natural 1 is critical success. a natural 20 means blunder.</p>
<p>if the <strong>gm</strong> thinks you have an advantage, roll two dice, keep the lowest number. in case of disadvantage, roll two dice, keep the highest.</p>
<h2 id="save-rolls">save rolls</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>gargl... — yess? — nah, not ya name, he zed &quot;gargl&quot;. he dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when the situation is desperate, if a character is poisoned, sick, taken into a trap, or is about to die (reaching zero <strong>hp</strong>), the <strong>gm</strong> may call for a <em>save roll</em>.</p>
<p>roll a d20. if it's <em>lower or equal</em> to <strong>lvl</strong>+7, you're safe. otherwise, it's a failure. (very) bad consequences happen.</p>
<p>it means death, most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="combat">combat</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>we be goblins! we be attaaaaaaak!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="initiative">initiative</h3>
<p>each player with characters involved in the fight will roll a d20 and compare it to <strong>current hp</strong>+7. players who succeed will act before the enemies, others will act after them. attacking by surprise will give them an advantage.</p>
<p><strong>important note:</strong> when three or more goblins attack the same foe, they all have an advantage for all their rolls related to the fight (including if they flee).</p>
<h3 id="attack-defend">attack &amp; defend</h3>
<p>you roll (d20 + enemy level) and compare it to your <strong>current hp</strong>+7. when using a 2-handed weapon, it's more difficult, add +2 to your roll.</p>
<p>on a success, you inflict <strong>d4</strong> hits.<br />
critical success inflicts <strong>2d4</strong> hits.<br />
two-handed weapons inflict <strong>d4+1</strong> hits (<strong>2d4+1</strong> on a crit').<br />
unarmed, bare-hand or improvised weapons inflict <strong>1</strong> hit, <strong>2</strong> on a critical success.</p>
<p>on a failure, you're hit by your ennemy. on a critical failure, damage is doubled.</p>
<p>since you'll be fighting classical <em>osr</em> adventurers or heroes, expect to receive from d6 to d8 or d10 damages each time you're hit.</p>
<p>please note that, even if your enemy is <em>not</em> in position to hit you, and you fail your roll, you're hit. in this case, damage is <strong>d4</strong>. have fun telling how you self-inflicted those hits.</p>
<h3 id="reaching-zero-hp">reaching zero hp</h3>
<p>when a character reaches zero <strong>hp</strong>, the player has to make a <strong>save roll</strong>. on a failure, the character dies. throw the character sheet away and start making a new one ; we're never out of goblins.</p>
<p>success would just mean that the goblin is <em>out of action</em>.</p>
<p>at the end of the combat scene, if nobody can heal or save the character, the goblin dies.</p>
<h3 id="armor">armor</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>dat? tis no kolander, tis me hellmeet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>each piece of armor acts like extra <strong>hp</strong>. when you're hit, they absorb the damage by their armor points (<strong>ap</strong>) level. but when they're reduced to zero, characters are taking damages that decreases their current <strong>hp</strong>.</p>
<p>right after the combat, if the goblin survives, all <strong>ap</strong> from their protection items are regenerated to their maximum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>example:</strong><br />
zlogo has 4 hp. he also has a helmet and a shield, so he has 3 ap.<br />
now he gets hit by a tall warrior that deals 1d8 damages. the warrior rolls a 6. so the first 3 damage points are absorbed by the helmet and the shield, but the next 3 reduce <em>zlago</em>'s <strong>hp</strong> to 1. <em>zlago</em> decides to escape the big person. once he's safe, hidden in a dark corridor, the <strong>gm</strong> announces that his <strong>ap</strong> is restored to their maximum (3), but he still only has 1 <strong>hp</strong> left.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="healing">healing</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>ointment, ointment, dis we want it! (goblin advertisment)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>goblins don't have many <strong>hp</strong>, but they recover quickly (their race wouldn't have survived otherwise). they'll gain 1 <strong>hp</strong> per hour of <em>complete rest</em>, up to their initial <strong>hp</strong> score.</p>
<p>shamans and healing potions can help, of course.</p>
<p><em>note:</em> shamans usually live in the colonies or near the rest of the tribe, and rarely go on adventure. the surviving goblins will have to find one if they need a shaman's healing powers. you may eventually play a shaman, if the <strong>gm</strong> agrees (see the &quot;shamans&quot; section in the optional rules below).<br />
the <em>healing ritual</em> of the shaman will work the same, whether they're a <strong>pc</strong>, a follower or a <strong>npc</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="experience">experience</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>yo rest young, yo ded ; yo rest old, yo ded too. — goblin proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>goblins usually start at level 0.</p>
<p>if they survive from their first adventure, they reach <strong>lvl</strong> 1.</p>
<p>then, if they fulfill <em>two</em> more adventures, they'll reach <strong>lvl</strong> 2.<br />
they'll probably remain at <strong>lvl</strong> 2 for quite some time.</p>
<p>then, if they survive to the <strong>big quest</strong>, they'll reach <strong>lvl</strong> 3, and they <em>can</em> retire.</p>
<p>optionally, you can keep on running for more adventures, it's how you'll like it. it could be fun having a very old goblin whinning at the youngsters. but there's no more <strong>lvl</strong> to gain, only glory.</p>
<h3 id="levelling-up">levelling up</h3>
<p>add +1 to your <strong>initial hp</strong>.</p>
<p>when you reach <strong>lvl</strong> 2, you can add a new <em>singularity</em> to your character, related to the adventures your goblin has survived to.</p>

<h1 id="optional-rules">optional rules</h1>
<h2 id="horde">horde</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>oi! oi! oi! we be hurd, we be hurd!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>goblins prefer living in small groups ; they're more comfortable when they mob. if the <strong>gm</strong> agrees, you can create up to d4 extra characters that compose your horde.</p>
<p>this number is your <em>maximum horde size</em>. it will only increase when you level up.</p>
<p>generally speaking, the playing character will be the chief of the small horde.</p>
<h3 id="horde-members">horde members</h3>
<p>creating a horde member:</p>
<ul>
<li>d4 <strong>hp</strong>,</li>
<li>can only pick <em>one gear</em>,</li>
<li><em>no</em> singularity.</li>
</ul>
<p>you can give them a name, but are you sure they will survive long enough to be renowned?</p>
<h3 id="actions-combat">actions &amp; combat</h3>
<p>actions rolls - as for the playing characters - uses <strong>current hp</strong>+7.</p>
<p>when the horde is involved in a fight, only the chief will roll for <em>initiative</em>. subsequent rolls (attack, defense, damages, saves...) will be individual. remember that goblins attacking in groups will have advantage on their rolls.</p>
<p>they'll recover their <strong>hp</strong> at the same rate than the playing characters.</p>
<h3 id="authority">authority</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>ya reely needz we attak zi fire beest? eet snailz &amp; snotz, ya creezy!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when the chief character wants to give horde members an order, and that they may <em>obviously</em> risk their lives, the player has to make an <em>action roll</em> to see if the horde would follow it. on a failure, the <strong>gm</strong> may decide what happens, or roll on the <em>rebellion table</em> below.</p>

<h3 id="chief-is-dead">chief is dead</h3>
<p>it may happen that the chief of a horde dies. if so, the horde is disbanded. other surviving characters may try to give orders to the remaining horde. the player has to make an <em>action roll</em> to see if the horde is ready to follow this new leader. failures would be handled alike authority failures.</p>
<p><em>please note:</em> these goblins that you have caught back will temporarily be members of your horde. as soon as the narrative allows it, they'll leave the party to return to their homes.</p>
<h3 id="levelling-up-1">levelling up</h3>
<p>each time you level up, you can add +1 horde member to your <em>maximum horde number</em>.<br />
horde members don't level up.</p>
<h3 id="hiring-new-members">hiring new members</h3>
<p>when you're next to unaffiliated goblins, you can try to hire some of them to fill your horde up to your <em>maximum horde number</em>. the player will make an <em>action roll</em> with appropriate <em>advantages</em> or <em>disadvantages</em> for each new goblin he wants to hire. on a failure, the process stops, you can't try to hire more goblins here, you'll have to find another group of goblins, or wait a bit longer (from a few days to several weeks) to get another chance.</p>
<h2 id="shamans">shamans</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>tis warm nay? — look! zshamann haz done fire to zakeetch bed! — ah. wil it curez? — nah. we be warm, zo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>shamans are important beings in the goblin society. they usually don't go on adventure. but the <strong>gm</strong> can allow a player to incarnate this character class. there shouldn't be more than one shaman in the group, unless you really want to.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-shaman">creating a shaman</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>blezzz! blezzz be da zshamann!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this character has:</p>
<ul>
<li>d4 hit points,</li>
<li>can only pick one gear, and none of which can be a weapon or an armor,</li>
<li>starts with d4+<em>lvl</em> initial ritual points (<strong>rp</strong>),</li>
<li>knows the <em>healing ritual</em> + one of those described below.</li>
</ul>
<p>shamans <strong>can't</strong> lead a horde. they have a sort of authority on the other goblins, but they can't be combat leaders.</p>
<p>the <strong>rp</strong> will be spent when shamans attempt to cast a ritual. they are regenerated at the rate of 1 per hour of <strong>complete rest</strong>, like the <strong>hp</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="rituals">rituals</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>be zshamann be djezture 'n speek same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>rituals have to be prepared. it takes one full round to pronounce the formula and make the appropriate gestures. during this round, the shaman <strong>can't walk or run</strong> and shouldn't be disturbed by anybody or anything, nor being touched.</p>
<p>if a shaman is disturbed during his preparation, one <strong>rp</strong> is spent, and the ritual process has to be restarted over again.</p>
<p>the round after the preparation, the shaman can make a <em>ritual roll</em>: d20 to be compared to <strong>lvl</strong>+7. as for the action rolls, if you roll strictly under it, you succeed. otherwise, you fail. a natural 1 is a critical success, a natural 20 is a critical failure.</p>
<p>on a <em>success</em>, one <strong>rp</strong> is spent and the ritual works as described.</p>
<p>on a <em>failure</em>, one <strong>rp</strong> is spent, and the ritual has to be prepared and successfully rolled again to be effective.</p>
<p>on a <em>critical failure</em>, on top of the consequence indicated in the ritual description:</p>
<ul>
<li>the shaman loses <strong>all</strong> his <strong>current rp</strong>, and has to rest at least a full hour to prepare any ritual again,</li>
<li>the shaman has to make a <em>save roll</em>. in case of failure, bad things happen: extra damages, hallucinations, black out,... obviously, this would give a disadvantage until this condition is removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>on a <em>critical success</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ritual works as described without any <strong>rp</strong> spent,</li>
<li>the shaman will roll with advantage on his next <em>ritual roll</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="healing-1">healing</h4>
<p>the shaman designates an ally and tries to cure their wounds. the shaman should touch them.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>critical success</em>: the <strong>hp</strong> are reaching their maximum score.</li>
<li><em>success</em>: the shaman heals d4 <strong>hp</strong>, up to the maximum initial <strong>hp</strong> score of the character.</li>

<li><em>critical failure</em>: the target character dies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="blessing">blessing</h4>
<p>the shaman designates an ally and tries to give them luck. the shaman should see the target.</p>

<li><em>failure</em>: no luck, the ritual has no effect.</li>
<li><em>critical failure</em>: the ally will make their next roll with a disadvantage.</li>

<h4 id="rile-up">rile up</h4>
<p>the shaman designates an ally and their horde. the targets should be able to hear the shaman.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>critical success</em>: the targets will double damage for the next round,</li>
<li><em>success</em>: the target makes +1 for each damage roll for the next round,</li>
<li><em>failure</em>: no extra damage, the ritual has no effect.</li>
<li><em>critical failure</em>: the targets will roll with disadvantage for the next round, and the horde chief has to make an <em>authority roll</em> to check their morale.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="shield">shield</h4>
<p>the shaman designates a target <em>or himself</em> to give them protection. the shaman should touch the target.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>critical success</em>: the target is granted +4 <strong>ap</strong> that will vanish after the end of the combat,</li>
<li><em>success</em>: the target is granted +1 <strong>ap</strong>,</li>
<li><em>failure</em>: no extra <strong>ap</strong>, the ritual has no effect.</li>
<li><em>critical failure</em>: the target protection, if any, is ineffective until the end of the fight. if the target was already with 0 <strong>ap</strong> left, the failed ritual inflicts d4 damages.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sleep">sleep</h4>
<p>the shaman designates a single target to put them to sleep. the target should be at sight.</p>
<p>as it is an offensive ritual, the shaman will roll a (d20 + target level) and compare it to <strong>lvl</strong>+7.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>critical success</em>: the target will sleep for d6 hours,</li>
<li><em>success</em>: the target will sleep for d6 minutes,</li>
<li><em>failure</em>: no sleep, the ritual has no effect.</li>
<li><em>critical failure</em>: the shaman is diving into sleep for d6 minutes.</li>

<p>shamans that go on adventure level up like their fellow goblins. as expected, their <strong>rp</strong> score goes up by 1 for each <strong>lvl</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-goblins-start">where do goblins start?</h2>
<p>you'll need to discuss with the players about the &quot;goblin gang&quot;.</p>
<p>are they living in a free colony, hidden in deep tunnels? are they serving the <strong>evil master</strong> of a dungeon, in exchange of food and shelter? are they living in a civilization where they're (almost) tolerated? are they raiding goblins, somehow free to wander in the wastelands and loot villages or isolated farms?</p>
<p>do they have a chief? if they do, who is it? what do they have in common? do they belong to the same clan?</p>
<p>do they have a shaman? is he far away? is he in safety?</p>
<p>what's their current situation? are they chased by other creatures or are they at peace?</p>
<p>if you want to keep it a bit more random, you can spice this up with the following tables and rules:</p>

<p>to randomly designate the horde chief, every character would make an <em>action roll</em> (<strong>current hp</strong>+7). if no <strong>pc</strong> succeeds, the chief is a <strong>npc</strong>. if only one <strong>pc</strong> succeeds, this character is the chief. if more than one have succeeded, the lowest roll wins the contest. you may eventually reroll if needed.</p>
<p>you may note that during the game, if the chief wants to give an order to the other goblins <strong>pc</strong>, he may have to make an authority roll. on a failure, the players can chose to rely on the <em>rebellion table</em> described in the &quot;horde&quot; section, or decide on their own how they're going to react.</p>

<p>if needed, level the shaman up accordingly by giving them additional rituals. of course, their <strong>hp</strong> and <strong>rp</strong> will also get increased.</p>

<p>the simplest is the best: you can use the &quot;monsters table&quot; from <strong>the black hack</strong>, slightly modified ; the <strong>lvl</strong> of the opponent would roughly be equivalent to their <strong>hd</strong>. you'll roll that many d8 to determine their <strong>hp</strong>. you can also use any <strong>osr</strong>-compatible bestiary that indicates the creature <strong>hd</strong>, and you're set.</p>

<p>monsters have 1 <strong>ap</strong> per <strong>hd</strong>, minus 1, to a maximum of 10.<br />
heroes would receive some <strong>ap</strong> to the discretion of the <strong>gm</strong>, according to their class and gear.</p>
<h4 id="monster-example">monster example</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>the goblins are setting up an ambush. a lonely fellow is approaching.<br />
this is a bugbear, <strong>hd</strong> 3. the <strong>gm</strong> rolls 3d8 which gives it 16 <strong>hp</strong>.<br />
it has 2 <strong>ap</strong> (<strong>hd</strong> - 1) and will deal 2d4 damages on a successful hit.<br />
there's nothing special about this monster. maybe the <strong>gm</strong> would give it a large weapon... a big club, for example?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="hero-example">hero example</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>the goblins are setting up an ambush. a lonely fellow is approaching.<br />
she's a <strong>lvl</strong> 3 elvish fighter. the <strong>gm</strong> rolls 3d8 that give her 13 <strong>hp</strong>.<br />
by default, she would make 2d4 damage per successful hit. this fighter is carrying a bow and a long knife. the <strong>gm</strong> decides that the long knife would make a d6 damage instead - she would preferrably use her bow.<br />
she's wearing a light leather armor, that'll give her 4 <strong>ap</strong>.<br />
will the goblins successfully ambush and kill her?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="osr-bx-retroclone-and-compatible.">osr, b/x, retroclone and compatible.</h3>
<p>pick your favorite bestiary, or any old-school compatible stat-block in an adventure module. as long as they have <strong>hd</strong>, <strong>hp</strong>, <strong>ac</strong> and damage dice, you can throw them at your goblins.</p>
<h3 id="heroes">heroes</h3>
<p>there are many rulesets out there that are compatible with the oldest <strong>rpg</strong>, and most of them allow fast character generation. your <strong>gm</strong> would easily pick their favorite character generation rules, roll a few dice, and make a character up in a snap. the only issue is to level them up, but that shouldn't be <em>that</em> difficult.</p>
<p>you may use <strong>the black hack</strong> chargen like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>let's make a fighter. roll 3d6 for <strong>str</strong> and <strong>dex</strong> (at least ; you may roll for the other stats if you need / want), 1d10+4 <strong>hp</strong>. the <strong>gm</strong> can give this fighter a chain mail, that grants 6 <strong>ap</strong>.<br />
the normal damage dice is d8 and d6 when unarmed.<br />
this character starts at <strong>lvl</strong> 1. to make it evolve to <strong>lvl</strong> 2, add a d10 <strong>hp</strong> ; roll a d20 for each stat, if it's strictly higher than the stat, it's increased by 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the <strong>gm</strong> may grant these <strong>npc</strong> some magic items, special abilities, special powers, etc. it might be a bit longer for magic-users and such, but it may improve the gaming experience, since the enemies will probably look more diverse and more challenging to overcome or evade.</p>
<h3 id="read-the-ancient-scrolls">read the ancient scrolls</h3>
<p>alternatively, any character compatible with the oldest <strong>rpg</strong> is alledgedly compatible this <strong>the gobz hack</strong>. why not searching for your old character sheets? you may gather old characters from past sessions and throw them against the goblin group. these <strong>pc</strong> will make perfect <strong>npc</strong> in this context.</p>

<p><em>“The Black Hack”</em>, by David Black, is the main source of inspiration. It uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hit Dice as a basic stat for Monsters,</li>
<li>Usage Dice,</li>
<li>The Advantage / Disadvantage mechanics (although it was not invented in The Black Hack),</li>
<li>Levelling up is decided by the Game Master and not based on XP count,</li>
<li>The initiative mechanism,</li>
<li>The Monster table.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Hunters of the Unknown”</em>, by John Grümph, uses the level of the character to define the “mastery level” ; I've used it for save rolls because it's a Darwinian way to explain how the luckiest goblins could survive.</p>
<p><em>“Goblin Quest”</em>, by Grant Howitt, is also an excellent RPG about playing goblins (but in a rather silly and surrealistic way).</p>
